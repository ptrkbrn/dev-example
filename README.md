# Text Connects Developer Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

- Width on the button a tags and listing titles was somewhat inconsisent in the Sketch file -- 258px on the leftmost listing, 250 on the others. I hardcoded both as 258px to be consistent with the image width and centered properly.

- As per the instructions I hardcoded the width and height of the images. Accordingly, I hardcoded various other styles, margins, etc., to keep it consistent and reproduce the appearance of the Sketch file in a standard browser window.
